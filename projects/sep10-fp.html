            <h1 class="margin text-center"> Movie Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For this project I was assigned the task with my partner Nixzy, to create a made up movie and have a website to explain a summary of what the movie would be about. We combined what we have recently learned in my Software Engineering class about two coding languages, HTML and CSS, to create it.  </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> We ended up making a website containing the content of a romantic horror type movie of a made up movie called "Haunted Love". The difficult love triangle of two boys, Cody and Colten, along with the girl they both love, Arden. Me and Nixzy both worked together to achieve every requirement needed to complete this project.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> There were many challenges in completing this task. One being trying to change the background into an image. This was something we have yet to have learned how to do in class and I had to figure out the code myself. Another challenge I encountered was trying to figure out the best way to format everything. We wanted the format to be organized, simple and pleasing to the eye, however I forgot how to center elements and work on the padding and margins. Luckily I had classmates who remembered how to do it which was very helpful as they taught me how to change the padding, width, etc to make it look nice. One takeaway that I learned was I need to work on my communication with my partner. Throughout this whole project, we weren't always in constant communication which made completing the website a lot more difficult. If we did talk more, some difficulties would have been eliminated. In the future I now know I have to communicate better and have a better partnership with future partners. Another takeaway I took from this project is that it is alright to ask for help. This was the first time I asked multiple people to figure out the code and because of that, I learned and got the tasks I needed to do done. This project was educational and entertaining.</p>
