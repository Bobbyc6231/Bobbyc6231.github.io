            <h2>Context</h2>
           <p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.hstat.org/"> High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology</a> in the<a href="https://hstatsep.github.io/"> Software Engineering Program</a>. The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.</p>


           <h2>Content</h2>
           <p>For my project, I chose to independently study <a href="https://kaboomjs.com/"> Kaboom</a> in order to help me make a game where a sprite has to collect a certain amount of something while avoiding obstacles to win.</p>


           <h2>Reflection</h2>
           <p>When I first started this project I knew quite literally nothing about javascript. I was scared as it looked intimidating and I wasn't sure if I would be able to understand anything I was doing. I then took the process day by day and throughout the timespan of a year, I understood little by little and ended up making my product. I wanted to make a game where a character had to collect stuff to win and so after a little brainstorming I came up with the idea to have Kung Fu Panda collect dumplings to win. The idea started off as a joke and then I said, why not. In kaboom there is a platformer playground which inspired me as it already had a lot of game concepts already pre-made. I Used their code as a beginning template which then all I had to do was alter some things. The first thing I had to do was add my own sprites. So I found images relating to things I enjoy and incorporated it into the game. This was difficult as my images had unwanted backgrounds, was too big and I couldn't decide on which ones to add. So I had to remove the background and try to figure out how to shrink the sprites. I tried a bunch of things then I tried to use <code>scale()</code> and added numbers less than 1 into the parameter which shrunk the images to what I wanted. The next step was for me to make it so that when Kung Fu Panda were to collect 100 dumplings, the player would win. So I added my own conditional stating if the player collected the 100 dumplings then the game would go to the Win Scene. Finally I added my own functions to make the game a little more interesting. All of my knowledge about Kaboom and Javascript came from dozens of hours of tinkering and trying my own things. It was not easy and definitely something new, but it was fun and I am glad to have done it. </p>
