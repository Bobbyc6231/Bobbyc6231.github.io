            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> This is my Create Your Own Adventure project. Me and my partner Stephanie were tasked to create a storyline where the user would be able to choose their own path. Each decision they make would change the direction of the outcome. Best part is they get to do it over and over to get different results.  </p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> The storyline we decided to go based on was doing homework. We worked together and using Markdown, we were able to create a short and fun story. The first two options were if they wanted to do their homework or not to do the homework. Depending on what choice they made and their choices after that, decided how their end grade would be.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> My teacher Mr. Mueller assigned this task for us to get more practice using Markdown as well as to get an opportunity to collaborate with a partner using github. This was our first attempt to use github freely on an assignment while working at the same time with someone else. While working together using Github, there will be conflicts at times and you will need a lot of communication. You need to constantly be talking to your partner about when you make a change and when they make a change. I myself didn't have an extreme issue with communicating as me and my partner both were usually on the same page. However I did have difficulty with the Markdown. I definitely had difficuly remembering how to create new files and how to make it so that when a link is pressed, the user is directed to a different file. I asked friends in my Software Engineering class if they could teach me which was a big help. I'm still getting used to this coding language and this project was great practice. If I were to redo this assignment, I would make sure I understood what I was doing before I started to code and hoped I would figure it out along the way. Which is what I did. I realized I should have double checked with my peers to make sure what I was doing was correct. When I originally started, I thought I could create my files and figure out how to code everything later. However what I was doing was actually making things harder then it had to be, so I restarted. Now I understand I should reassure myself I know that I'm doing things the way it's supposed to be done. I would have also liked to add more than the bare minimum. For instance I would have liked to add more pathways for the user to go and add more and different storylines. Overall, this project was a fun and educational one. </p>
